**The year is 2391.**

Mankind has long expanded into the great starry void. 
War after war, its path across outer space was paved by the flesh and bone of the fallen, 
countless in number. Even now, at the dawn of newfound peace, 
the echoes of battles to come ring in the ears of the survivors, 
a grim reminder that all that lives is shackled to the unbreakable chains of history…

**...but hey, at least we've got giant robot arenas now.**

Scattered across the Outer Colonies under the ownership of Galactica Sports Entertainment, 
"Fist World" combat circuits are a staple of recreational Battleframe combat, 
turning the worlds hosting them into bustling hubs of tourism, 
industry and under-the-counter gambling when the venue's rent-a-cops aren't looking.

**So, all things considered, not an entirely terrible deal.**

Especially for the populace of a remote planet that, 
after some two hundred years of isolation, 
resource scarcity and desperate struggle for survival, 
eventually saw its homeworld become the main theater of an interstellar conflict. 
After all, the cities are already in shambles and the planet's only moon 
has been sliced in two - letting some offworlders build a couple of stadiums 
could hardly make things any worse.

_**Welcome to Fist World Volga!**_

**The year is 2394**

Nine years after the
tide of violence wrought by the Great Colonial War has upset a
century-old balance of power, humanity is once again entering an era
of fragile peace.

From the ashes of
the old Avignon Empire, firestarter of the conflict, a federation of
former vassal worlds has risen - denying the tantalizing offer of
growth and prosperity under the ever-increasing reach of the United
Systems Alliance in favor of long-awaited independence.

**Welcome to the Tremerine Union.**

You and your
companions find yourselves in the midst of all this, sailing the sea
of the stars on the same starship for one reason or another: on a
mission, in search of profits, or simply looking for a good time.
Each of you may come from a different background or work a different
profession, but you will need to cooperate to get the job done.

_**Who will you be in this galaxy of opportunities?**_

**The year is 2395.**

A decade after the
war that shook the Outer Colonies and brought the Avignon Empire to
its knees, the Confederation of Shardana, an idyllic ocean world in
the Aurelia System, has finally returned to relative normalcy. As the
hulks of orbital warships float along coastlines lined with rubble,
it’s clear that the worst has come to pass - and now, the only way
to go is foward.

**Forward into an uncertain, if ever so hopeful, future.**

Organized by the
Deadalus Consortium, Hydro Trail GP is an all-new naval racing
championship designed to bring new eyes to the otherwise niche
Shardanian national sport - a way to show, through glamourous events
and cutting edge technology, that Shardana is prepared for the
future.

**Six heats, five teams, one champion.**

As engines and
rivalries alike flare up, the eyes of the Outer Colonies turn from
Volga’s biomecha brawling to the sparkling blue waters of the Pearl
of Aurelia. The starting grid is waiting, can you take the heat?

_**Fasten your seatbelts and link up your drinking cable for Hydro Trail GP!**_

**SIRIUS: TREACHEROUS REACHES**

**Release Date: [TBA]**

**Media Type: Social Deduction Board Game**

**Platform: Itch.io**


<div style="min-height: 0.5em"></div>
<hr style="height: 2px; background-color: black; border: none;">
<div style="min-height: 0.5em"></div>

**The year is 2397.**

Lightyears away from
the blossoming Cosmic East, the sea of stars has become playing field
to an orbital shadow war. The prize? The allegiance of the
Sovereignty of Sirius - and the riches it can to offer to its new
masters.

**A shining gem of the void, torn apart from the inside.**

The inhabitants of
the Sirius System, from the highest-standing Kshatriya Admiral to the
most destitute Shudra miner, have found themselves tangled into a
silent civil war seeded by neighboring superpowers. All it takes is
one “Blackout Mine”: paranoia and Caste-based grudges will do the
rest.

**In the shadow of the stars, no one can hear you scheme.**

Life support systems
are down to the bare minimum, maneuvering thrusters are dead and long
range communications are fried: all you can do is listen to the pleas
of the unfortunate souls stuck in this mess with you, trying to track
their vessel through the radio waves and hoping they’re not using
this time to get a bead on your position.

_**Fill up your air tanks and pray you can survive Sirius: Treacherous Reaches.**_
