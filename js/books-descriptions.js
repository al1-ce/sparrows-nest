### *The year is 2000 A.D.*

The world's foremost superpower, the Federation of Pan-Europa, is heading into disarray.  As infrastructure decays and violent militias carve up increasing swathes of its territory,  the stability of its collective unconscious also finds itself under siege from a whole new kind of threat.

### *Psychohazards: viruses of the mind.*

Whether through purposeful misinformation or rumors spiraling out of control, the threat posed by psychohazards has led to the establishment of a new kind of police unit: one meant to investigate and eradicate them at the source - by any means necessary.

### *Enter the "Psycho Patrol".*

Founded by clamored criminologist Lorenzo Visconti as a new kind of high-tech, anti-hitlerite force guided by the principles of Wilhelm Reich, the European Federal Police's new "Psycho Patrol" is a fledgling institution unpopular among its peer organizations, but brimming with potential. The perfect place for someone like you.

### *So misunderstood, so full of potential.*

So go ahead, grab this zine and get acquainted: featuring over 20 pages of useful tidbits, character insights and mildly disconcerting fanart, ORIENTATION is the perfect introduction to the peculiar world of PSYCHO PATROL R, the latest in FPS/RPG europolice simulation by CONSUMER SOFTPRODUCTS. This zine was composed with their blessing and help, allowing us access to the game for playtesting and design advisory purposes. 

All in-game assets depicted, such as weapon models and character portraits, were sourced from CONSUMER SOFTPRODUCTS’ development archives, and all original writing therein was carefully vetted before finalization – to make sure each character’s individual neuroses are rendered accurately and faithfully.

As the only human left on Twin Terra with an iron backbone, a strong sense of justice and very few moral boundaries, only you can pull the Pan-European Federation back from the brink of disaster.

### *Good luck out there, Officer.*
