    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <p>
        We could open this section with a statement about the meaning of our
        name: about how the fleeting, virtual essence of the “Data Sparrow” is
        an allegory for a collective with no physical headquarters, no “roots”
        but rather “wings”, spanning across this strange world in the form of
        our members – as it’s only thanks them that the Sparrow can take flight
        and reach new heights.
    </p>
    <p>
        But that’d be one flight of fancy too many for what amounts to a group
        of all-too-eager hobbyists, so let’s keep our feet on the ground for
        now.
    </p>

    <h1>SO, WHAT IS DATA SPARROW?</h1>
    <p>
        Basically, Data Sparrow is an art collective. For what kind of art?
        Whichever we have the facilities and ideas to pursue, mostly. Currently,
        we’re focusing on tabletop games and printed media. In the future? Who
        knows! Nothing is off the table aside from a few, obviously unethical
        endeavors that have been catching on these past couple of years, so if
        we ever have the means to actually put out a videogame or two, we’ll
        most certainly try.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our aesthetic preferences and areas of expertise are as many as our
        members, but our founding value is the point around which it all pivots:
        branch out whenever you can, don’t let ideas overstay their welcome,
        keep it varied and fun.
    </p>

    <h1>ONE UNIVERSE…</h1>
    <p>
        To this end, our projects currently take place in a single, expansive
        universe designed from the ground up as a creative playground with
        minimal guidelines. This streamlines setting-level writing immensely, as
        all projects get to be on the same historical timeline and all that’s
        needed is defining the details of the particular locations in which each
        project takes place.
    </p>
    <div style="padding: 0.2em;"></div>
    <h1>…MANY STORIES</h1>
    <p>
        This, however, doesn’t mean there’s some sort of grand converging
        narrative going on: every Data Sparrow endeavor is a standalone work,
        whose only references to other works amount to the natural amounts of
        cross-pollination resulting from two planets being neighbors, or two
        sports occupying the same niche. You can come in wherever, you can come
        out wherever.

        If any of this stuff sounds up your alley, you’re welcome to take a look
        at our projects and <a href="/html/contact.html">contact us</a> if you
        want to know more about anything we’re currently working on! We don’t
        like to show things publicly unless we know they fundamentally work and
        are 100% going to be released, but a question or two never hurt anyone.
