### *The year is 2390*

In the three years since the end of the Great Colonial War, mankind's reach has been reshaped by a whirlwind of pacts, treaties and conventions. The age of the sword, of the fleur du lys and military nobility is over.

### *Now begins anew the age of pen and coin.*

In the two years since the end of the Great Colonial War, a single-system polity of relative importance has been reshaped by the invisible hand of capital. The Most Serene Autocracy of Triunfo is dead, long live the Triunfo Solidarity Republic.

### *Mission Accomplished! ...Now what?*

Established by the United Systems Alliance Intercorporate Coalition (USAIC), the Helping Hand Initiative is a reconstruction and privatization effort aiming to bring the Solidarity Repubic's economic policy and output up to  "Alliance Standard". To introduce "the beauty of the free market" to the former planetary dictatorship, with all that it entails.

### *People will die, but that's a sacrifice you are willing to make.*

Rebuilding Triunfo is a 4-player, free-for-all economic warfare card game inspired by Machi Koro, Monopoly and the 1979 Dune board game, in which you and three soon-to-be-enemies take the role of Coordinators: shadowy corporate figures doubling as both executives and military strategists, trying to carve out as big as slice of Triunfo's economy as you can in a no-cards-barred contest of risky acquisitions, frequent betrayal and bluff-based card combat. Win by sheer market share, military power or by wooing the Republic's government with an Artificial Wonder. And remember: destruction is not "mutually assured" if you own all the nukes.

### *Rebuilding Triunfo won't be easy, but that's what friends are for.*
